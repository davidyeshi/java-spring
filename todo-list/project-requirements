PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

- The to-do list application will be a simple application that will manage to-do items.
- A to-do item will be represented by a simple class with the fields: title, details, and deadline(date).
- The main requirement is performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete).


## Pages
- A page for viewing all the to-do items in the table with their title and deadline.
- A page for viewing a single to-do item including its details.
- A page for updating a single to-do item.
- A page for creating a new to-do item.


- Deleting functionality that removes a single to-do item from the list.
- A home page with a welcome message and a link to the page with all the items.
- For simplicity, data will be stored in memory. Later in the course, we will use databases, JPA, Hibernate and so on.
